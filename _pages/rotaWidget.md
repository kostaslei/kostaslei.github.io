        <p> Rota Widget stands as my maiden freelance endeavor, specifically tailored for doctors in the UK. The app provides users with the ability to log in securely, granting them access to their schedules. The interface is optimized through the inclusion of both medium and large widgets. The medium widget thoughtfully condenses daily schedules to present up to 2 events, while the expansive large widget accommodates up to 10 events for a comprehensive overview.
        </p>
        
        <p>To enrich user experience, a subscription model is available, allowing users to become Plus members for a nominal fee of £1 per year. This unlocks premium features, including expedited data refresh and increased data fetch capabilities.
        </p>
        
        <p>Security is a top priority in Rota Widget—sensitive user data is stored with the utmost care using Keychain, while less sensitive data finds its home in UserDefaults. The app is crafted entirely using SwiftUI, adhering to the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern. Subscriptions are seamlessly managed through StoreKit, and the widgets are skillfully implemented using WidgetKit.
        </p>
        
        <p>Rota Widget encapsulates both functionality and user-centric design, offering a streamlined and secure solution for managing schedules on the go.
