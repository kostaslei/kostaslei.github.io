        <p> My team and I participated in the New Year's Resolution Game Jam hosted by Bitter Sails. Cosmos Countdown emerged as a dynamic 2D game created during the game jam. The game unfolds as a riveting race against time, where players are tasked with collecting essential resources to construct a rocket, poised to launch and avert an impending meteor disaster.
        </p>
        
        <p>Gameplay centers around the strategic redirection of airplanes to specific facilities before the clock runs out. The challenge lies in orchestrating a seamless flow of resources to ensure the success of the mission.
        </p>
        
        <p>This game received favorable review during the judging phase, with commendation for its fresh take on the classic redirecting planes concept.

        <p class="notice--success">
         The immersive context of saving Earth adds depth to the gaming experience, and the pacing is finely tuned to deliver an adrenaline rush. While the cloud storm element could use a touch more dynamism, the overall art and music garnered positive feedback. The judges noted the impressive achievement of developing a compelling game within a week, praising the well-thought-out design and coding. Cosmos Countdown stands as a testament to the team's dedication and creativity in producing a successful and enjoyable gaming experience.
